> [!NOTE]
> **Autoresearch is bigger than one repo now.** The core pattern is simple and powerful: **pick a metric, constrain the scope, let an agent iterate, and keep only what improves**.

This list tracks repos that either:

- directly build on Karpathy's idea,
- explicitly reference `autoresearch`, or
- apply the same edit → verify → keep/revert loop in a clear adjacent domain.

## 🛠️ General-purpose descendants

- [uditgoenka/autoresearch](https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch) — Claude Code skill that generalizes autoresearch into a reusable loop for software, docs, security, shipping, debugging, and other measurable goals.
- [leo-lilinxiao/codex-autoresearch](https://github.com/leo-lilinxiao/codex-autoresearch) — Codex-native autoresearch skill with resume support, lessons across runs, optional parallel experiments, and mode-specific workflows.
- [davebcn87/pi-autoresearch](https://github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch) — `pi` extension plus dashboard for persistent experiment loops, live metrics, confidence tracking, and resumable autoresearch sessions.
- [drivelineresearch/autoresearch-claude-code](https://github.com/drivelineresearch/autoresearch-claude-code) — Claude Code plugin/skill port of `pi-autoresearch`, with a clean experiment-loop workflow and a concrete biomechanics case study.
- [mutable-state-inc/autoresearch-at-home](https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/autoresearch-at-home) — Collaborative fork of upstream autoresearch that adds experiment claiming, shared best-config syncing, hypothesis exchange, and swarm-style coordination across many single-GPU agents.

## 🔬 Research-agent systems

- [aiming-lab/AutoResearchClaw](https://github.com/aiming-lab/AutoResearchClaw) — End-to-end research pipeline that turns a topic into literature review, experiments, analysis, peer review, and paper drafts; broader than autoresearch, but clearly in the same lineage.
- [wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep) — Markdown-first research workflows for Claude Code and other agents, centered on autonomous literature review, experiments, paper iteration, and cross-model critique.
- [Sibyl-Research-Team/AutoResearch-SibylSystem](https://github.com/Sibyl-Research-Team/AutoResearch-SibylSystem) — Fully autonomous AI scientist built on Claude Code, with explicit AutoResearch lineage, multi-agent research iteration, GPU experiment execution, and a self-evolving outer loop.
- [hyperspaceai/agi](https://github.com/hyperspaceai/agi) — Distributed, peer-to-peer research network where autonomous agents run experiments, gossip findings, maintain CRDT leaderboards, and archive results to GitHub across multiple research domains.

## 💻 Platform ports and hardware forks

- [miolini/autoresearch-macos](https://github.com/miolini/autoresearch-macos) — Widely adopted macOS fork that adapts upstream autoresearch for Apple Silicon / MPS while preserving the original loop shape.
- [trevin-creator/autoresearch-mlx](https://github.com/trevin-creator/autoresearch-mlx) — MLX-native Apple Silicon port that keeps the upstream fixed-budget `val_bpb` loop while removing the PyTorch/CUDA dependency entirely.
- [jsegov/autoresearch-win-rtx](https://github.com/jsegov/autoresearch-win-rtx) — Windows-native RTX fork focused on consumer NVIDIA GPUs, with explicit VRAM floors and a practical desktop setup path.

## 🎯 Domain-specific adaptations

- [chrisworsey55/atlas-gic](https://github.com/chrisworsey55/atlas-gic) — Applies the autoresearch keep-or-revert loop to trading agents, optimizing prompts and portfolio orchestration against rolling Sharpe ratio instead of model loss.
- [RightNow-AI/autokernel](https://github.com/RightNow-AI/autokernel) — Applies the autoresearch loop to GPU kernel optimization: profile bottlenecks, edit one kernel, benchmark, keep or revert, repeat.
- [Rkcr7/autoresearch-sudoku](https://github.com/Rkcr7/autoresearch-sudoku) — Enhanced autoresearch workflow where an AI agent iteratively rewrites and benchmarks a Rust sudoku solver, ultimately beating leading human-built solvers on hard benchmark sets.
